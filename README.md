# wordanalyzer
Mobile application exercise

Firstly, I use stateful statement for this application.
The stateful statement means that it had a constructor() part and a render() part.
Next, I initially define the properties in the constructor.
The updateWord() is to display the string being input by user.
The countCharacter() is to calculate the number of characters in a given string.
Both updateWordVows() and updateWordCons() functions to find out the amount of vowels and consonants in the given string. Inside both of them are the for() loop.
In the render() section, all of the part necessary to output the results are placed.
I also added a color (#00FFFF) for the button styles.
